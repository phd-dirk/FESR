Steps to run the code:

* Put selected sets of s_0's for fits in "s0s_fit.f90" and for
  output in "s0s_out.f90". The total number of s_0's has to be
  specified explicitely at the beginning of these files.

* Select weight functions for the fit in "weights_used.f90".
  The total number of weights has to be specified explicitely
  at the beginning of these files.

* Select DV contribution to these weights in dualvio.f90.

* Depending on whether only V or V&A are used for the fit switch
  off/on V/A cross-correlations in "VAmomOpal.f90".

* Modify starting parameters for fit and select parameters to
  be fitted in "rtauVfit.f90" or "rtauVAfit.f90".
