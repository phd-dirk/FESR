Some loose ends:
================

* Include possibility of choosing different sets of s_0's for
  different weight functions in A and V+A analysis.

* Investigate DV model which has the correct analytic properties.

* Improve numerical routine for integration over duality violations.

* Compute pion-pole contribution from B(tau -> pi nu_tau).

* Implement dependence of running of alpha_s on perturbative order.

* Should we generalise atauBJ dependence in condens.f90?
  (In principle yes.)

* Investigate dependence of Gauss integration on ngau.
  (Improve Gauss integration by substitution?)

* Speed up contour integration by performing all contributions at once.

* Include OPE for scalar/pseudoscalar correlators.

* Perform moment fit to e+e- spectral function
